a mess of code that will (hopefully) one day be a console text editor

TODO
* Fix unicode issues. Right now the code assumes that each character is exactly 1 byte, which is _wrong_ and will make trusty _panic_ on files that contain multi-byte characters! This is _very bad_!

## License
I highly doubt that _anyone_ would want to have anything to do with this right now, but if you really want to mess with it, trusty is released under the MIT license.
